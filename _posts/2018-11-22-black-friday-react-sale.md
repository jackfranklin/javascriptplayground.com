In the past year I've launched two video courses on React, and today I'm offering 40% off them over the Black Friday period.

You can use the coupon code `JACKFRIDAY` to take 40% off, and it works on both courses.

- [Buy React in Five here](/react-in-five)
- Or [Testing React with Enzyme and Jest here](/testing-react-enzyme-jest)

Buying the courses not only gets you access to the current content, but any updates to them forever, and I assure you that there's updates planned in the near future, with some more testing content on its way.
