<p>In this 7 minute screencast I discuss the usages of the <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> methods within JavaScript.</p>

<p>The methods are really useful when you need to invoke a method and have total control over the scope in which it is called. This is something that personally really confused me when I was learning, so I hope this helps some people. If you are still confused, please leave a comment and I will get back to you.</p>
