title: Meet pulldown
---

A good couple of months ago, I sat down with fellow JavaScripter [Tom Ashworth](http://twitter.com/phuunet) to rewrite my JS tool [pulldown](https://github.com/jackfranklin/pulldown). I thought it would be of interest to readers, both as a useful tool, and an example of developing relatively complex CLI tools.

Pulldown will help you quickly and easily download libraries. For example, running:

    $ pulldown jquery

Will instantly download you the latest minified source of the jQuery library. We use [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/) to search for what you looked for. It can also do versioning:

    $ pulldown jquery@1.8.2

It's __not supposed__ to be a replacement for Bower, nor is it meant to replicate the features, but it's designed to sit right in the middle. If you need a quick CLI way to download a library, this might just be of use.

It's fully documented [in the Github repo](https://github.com/jackfranklin/pulldown) and you can install it right now through npm:

    $ npm install -g pulldown

If you do use it, please get in touch if you have any (good or bad) feedback. Would love to hear it.
