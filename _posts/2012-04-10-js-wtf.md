title: "JS WTF: 5 &lt; 4 &lt; 3"
---

A quick fun "JS WTF?" post for you today. If you load up your JavaScript console & enter:

	5 < 4 < 3
	
You'd be expecting to see `false`, right? However, you'll actually see `true`. __WTF?__

This is actually down to the way JavaScript evaluates this and _operator precedence_. What it sees is:

	(5 < 4) < 3
	
Which in turn gives

	false < 3
	
JavaScript then coerces `false` into an integer `0`:

	0 < 3
	
And zero is indeed less than 3, so we get `true` returned. 

Not much learned from this one but it's quite a fun thing to show someone & then explain why. I'll be trying to do a lot of these small "fun" posts as there's a fair few areas of "WTF?" in JavaScript, as we all know.
