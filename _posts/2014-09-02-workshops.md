title: Upcoming JavaScript Workshops
intro: Later in the year I'm going to be doing workshops in Bristol and London and I'd love to see you there!

Coming up in October and November I'm doing two different workshops; the first in Bristol and the second in London.

## Web Dev Conf

On the **9th of October** I'm doing a workshop on building web apps with NodeJS and Express in Bristol. It runs for about three hours in the afternoon and tickets cost £50. You can [buy them through the WDC site](http://2014.webdevconf.com/workshops/#jackfranklin).

## White October Events

On the **4th of November**, I'm doing a full day workshop on JS Tooling with Grunt and Gulp. White October are the folks behind jQuery UK, one of the best conferences I've attended before and I'm sure they are going to do an awesome job with the workshops. Tickets for this full day workshop at Imperial College, London cost £270 + VAT and can be bought [on the White October site](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/javascript-workshops/introduction-to-js-tooling/).

If you have any questions about the workshops please get in touch, and I hope to see you at one of them!
