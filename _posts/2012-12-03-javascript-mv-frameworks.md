title: "JavaScript MV* Frameworks"
---

> "The massive growth in rich, JavaScript-heavy web applications has lead to a huge array of frameworks designed to help you build apps. There are so many that it can often be difficult to choose which best suits your needs, so in this article I'll discuss five of the most popular, and look at where each of their strengths lie. You shouldn't base your decision entirely on this article - I encourage you to play further with a framework before committing - but I hope this sets you off in the right direction."

Another article I wrote for .net magazine went live last week: [Five JavaScript MV* Frameworks](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/essential-javascript-top-five-mvc-frameworks). In it I take a look at Backbone, Ember, Angular, Batman and Knockout. It's a high level summary of each so if you've been wondering which may suit your needs best, or what the differences are, I hope it may be of use.
