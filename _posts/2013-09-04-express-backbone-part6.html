title: "Building an App with Express and Backbone: Part 6"
intro: Part 6 looks at tidying up our work in Part 5 by introducing the Backbone Router and collection events.
---

<p>In this episode we'll not add any more features, but tidy up our work from last time. We'll add some structure with the Backbone Router and prevent doing work in Ajax request callbacks by instead listening to events.</p>
