title: The Refactoring Tales book
intro: I've written up some refactoring case studies that look at improving existing code and writing maintainable code into a small ebook.

Something that I've been researching into a lot recently is refactoring - one of the most popular posts on this blog was [the one on refactoring](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2013/06/refactoring-js/). I really have enjoyed getting stuck into the principles of large systems development, and how to keep code maintainable over time and as it grows.

I've been collecting some examples of this from tutorials I've written and real life code for a while, and have been writing them up into case studies. Today I finished my fourth write up, and I've decided to parcel them up into a small book, which I've called "The Refactoring Tales".

"The Refactoring Tales" is a collection of case studies (currently four examples, but more being written) that look at specific code examples and ways they can be improved, going through the stages of refactorings and the reasoning behind them. I also discuss some principles like coupling and single responsibility, along with many more.

## Free Online

You can read the book in its entirety [online here](/the-refactoring-tales), and even check out the source [on GitHub](https://github.com/jackfranklin/the-refactoring-tales) if it interests you. Please remember that the book is **not yet finished**, this is somewhat of a beta release. There is more content to come, along with refinements to the existing content too.

If you'd like to support the JavaScript Playground, you can purchase a digital download version for $15, which gives you access to the PDF, EPUB and MOBI versions of the book. Buying the book helps me dedicate more time to this site, but also ensures you full access to the current **and all future** editions of the book.

If you'd like to try before you buy, you can read it online, and the content in the downloadable versions is identical to the content online.
