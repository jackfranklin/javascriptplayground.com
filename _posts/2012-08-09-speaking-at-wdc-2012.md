title: "Speaking at WDC 2012"
---

I've attended [WDC](http://www.webdevconf.com) for the past two years so when Alex (@alexolder) gave me the chance to speak I couldn't say no. Having been at WDC the past two years I can tell you it's a great day out and the after party is always great fun too. If you're able to make it I'd highly recommend it. Tickets are only £60 or £40 if you're a student. As an extra bonus if you use the discount code "jackfollowers" you'll get a little bit of money off.

As of yet my talk title is not defined but it will be JavaScript based (obviously).

Hope to see you there!
