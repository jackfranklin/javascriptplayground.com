I'm sure that [Kent](http://twitter.com/kentcdodds) needs no introduction, he's a prolific contributor to the React community and ecosystem. One of the things he talks a lot about is testing, which just so happens to be one of my favourite topics, too!

In this hour long hangout, Kent and I compared our approaches, both where they align and where we have slightly different opinions. If you're interested in hearing a deep dive on how to test React applications, this should really help. We mention different approaches, libraries and resources that have helped us get started with and improve our respective testing philosophies.

Don't forget, if you are after some more testing resources, that my [Testing React with Enzyme and Jest](https://javascriptplayground.com/testing-react-enzyme-jest/) course is available now!
