title: "Converting a JS library to TypeScript: Part 1"
intro: A new free video series starts today where I'm recording myself as I work converting an open source project into TypeScript.
---

I've been wanting a project to dive into to help me learn TypeScript, and the
other day on an issue for
[test-data-bot](https://github.com/jackfranklin/test-data-bot), someone asked if
TypeScript definitions were available. I decided this was a good way for me to
dive in and try converting a library to TS, and I decided to record it and share
for anyone else wondering what the process looks like!

Rather than create streamlined, snappy, short videos like I do for my paid
courses, these videos will be ~15 minutes long and show you a much less edited
version of how I work. You'll see how I use my editor, how I go about driving
code with tests and how I debug when I get stuck. I'm not a TypeScript expert,
so there's a fair amount of time spent figuring out TypeScript together!

You can watch it on YouTube, either by

or using the embedded player below. I filmed the video in 1080p so it should be
crystal clear ðŸ‘Œ.
