title: ReactJS workshops in London
intro: Come and join me for a day of ReactJS learning in London
---

If you've ever been interested in learning more about React and getting to grips with the framework then I have some good news for you! I've teamed up with [White October Events](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/) to run two one day ReactJS workshops in London.

These workshops will be a great chance for you to dive into React with a tonne of hands on exercises (you'll be writing lots of code!) covering not only the core concepts of React but some of the most popular libraries, including Redux and React Router.

In addition we'll look at ES2015, Babel, Webpack and more as we dive into building complex applications with the React ecosystem.

Tickets will cost £299 which includes lots of refreshements and lunch. The workshops are being run on two dates:

* [21st March 2016](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/reactjs-workshop-march-16/)
* [10th June 2016](http://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/event/reactjs-workshop-june-16/)
