title: "A New JS Playground Update"
---

Today I spent a bit of time updating the site, and as such it seemed like a good time to write a small blog post with some updates.

__Disqus__

I have now moved site comments over to Disqus. This does lose all previous comments (they are still in the DB, just not visible) which is a shame, but I was finding it hard to keep up with the old system. Disqus also offers a much nicer interface and tools to enable much better discussions to take place within the comments, so I think this will really help me keep up to date with comments and reply in a much more organised and clearer fashion.

__The Book__

I am still hard at work with my book! There are now just two chapters left, and the end is in sight. Once the book is done I hope to be able to return to my previous writing frequency on this site. You can also [preorder the book now!](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-jQuery-Jack-Franklin/dp/1430249323/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1353848521&sr=8-1) from Amazon. It's out on February 6th, 2013.

__Open Source__

I've been working ons ome open source libraries that some readers might find interesting: [jQuery Form Validator](https://github.com/jackfranklin/jQuery-Form-Validator), [Nodefetch](http://github.com/jackfranklin/nodefetch) and [Magna Charta](https://github.com/alphagov/magna-charta).

__Content is coming__

Tomorrow I'm excited to post the second screencast I've recorded. I've been practicing screencasts and I'm feeling more confident now, so hopefully in the future the split of screencast vs article will be a bit more even.

__Feedback Welcome__

As always, if you have any feedback, or requests, or would like to write for the site, please do just get in touch. I'd be happy to chat.
