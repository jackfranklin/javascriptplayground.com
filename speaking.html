<h3>Speaking at your event</h3>
<p>I have a lot of experience speaking at industry conferences, meet-ups and events. I'm always keen to get involved  and normally fit best into technical events with a focus on JavaScript or front end development generally.</p>

<p>If you'd like to have me speak at your event please do get in touch. You can email jack@jackfranklin.net or <a href="http://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin">DM me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<h3>My speaker details</h3>
