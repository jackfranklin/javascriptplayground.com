<p>You've managed to find a broken URL! Please accept my apologies.</p>

<p>In early 2020 I moved my blog from JavaScriptPlayground.com to my own personal site at jackfranklin.co.uk. I setup redirects but you might have found something that I missed :)</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin">tweet me</a> and let me know so I can fix it.</p>
