          <p>If you're writing React in any capacity, this course if for you! This course assumes a base level understanding of React, but whether you're working on small React side projects or full React applications at the day job, you'll learn how to test a variety of React components.</p>

          <p>No prior knowledge of testing or React specific testing is required; we'll start from scratch and build up our testing knowledge over this set of ten videos.</p>

          <p>Along with how-tos we'll also talk about characteristics of well written tests and how to avoid common pitfalls when writing tests.</p>

          <h3>What will I learn?</h3>

          <p>See below for a full list of topics covered in the videos of this course, but in a nutshell this course contains all you need to be confident testing a variety of React components. We'll cover:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The roles that Jest and Enzyme play in writing React tests.</li>
            <li>How to test for UI changes in React components using Jest snapshots.</li>
            <li>Testing React components that make HTTP requests by mocking HTTP requests.</li>
            <li>Using Jest spies to mock behaviour in React components for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Testing React components that are connected to Redux, including how to test dispatching actions.</li>
            <li>Using Enzyme's mount API to test lifecycle methods like <code>componentDidMount</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate</code>.</li>
          </ul>
